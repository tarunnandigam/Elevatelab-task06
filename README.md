==>Through this task, I learned how to host a static website using GitHub Pages. I understood how a simple HTML file can be deployed and made accessible to anyone on the internet using just a GitHub repository. By connecting my local project to GitHub and enabling GitHub Pages, I learned how the main branch automatically serves the website without needing any server setup. I also understood the importance of version control whenever I update and push new changes, the live site gets updated instantly. Additionally, by customizing the page using CSS, I learned how to improve the design and styling of a webpage. Overall, this task helped me understand the complete process of deploying, managing, and maintaining a static website for free using GitHub Pages.
